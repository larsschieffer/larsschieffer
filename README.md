## 🌟 About Me

My absolute passion lies in creating products that make our everyday lives easier.
I detest nothing more than doing the same things over and over again.

Now, unfortunately, I have two left hands when it comes to topics like electrical circuits or creating inventions like washing machines or dishwashers.
Fortunately, through my skills as a software developer, I can enable digital products that take work off our hands or offer exciting tasks in our spare time.
So far, I have been able to solve manually complex tasks through a time-tracking calendar, the easy recording of card game results, and improving the product for registering damages in windscreens.
I’m really lucky that all the different groups I worked with had a great team spirit.
Everyone was able to contribute his/her strengths to improve the products so that they can be loved by thousands of users today.

## 🚀 My Philosophy

To be always able to find the best solutions for emerging challenges, continuous training is essential for me because the focus is always on creating the best product for the customer.  
Frameworks for the frontend or backend are always just tools, so the highest interest for myself is to be able to handle them competently.
Therefore, it doesn’t matter if the product uses Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, … I’m in!

## 🌍 Beyond Coding

To create exciting applications again and again, it is important to think outside the box of software development.
I love to explore the world!
Travelling together with my wife always gives us new impressions.
During my studies of computer science, I became a little bookworm, so you will find me on the weekend with a cup of hot tea and a good book or “The Economist”.
